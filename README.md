# D-SpamPH: An SMS Spam Detection Mobile Application with Reporting Platform 
Hello, IT Geek! This is a Mobile and Web Application Project created by BSIT Students of West Visayas State University - College of Information and Communications Technology. This Mobile/Web-App project utilizes Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and serves as the algorithm for the detection of spam messages in the mobile app. Spam data is uploaded into Firebase Firestore. Flask API endpoint is used to retrieve the uploaded spam data from the mobile app to the web.


# Project Objectives
The main objective of this study is to design, develop, evaluate, and implement an SMS spam detection mobile application with a reporting platform that will significantly yield useful web-based analytics for it target users.

Where it specifically aimed to:
   > Develop a Machine Learning Model using LSTM for SMS Spam Detection and Reporting System Mobile Application (D-SpamPH) and to test the accuracy of the proposed model using Accuracy, Recall, Precision, and F1 Score;
   > Develop a reporting dashboard using web-based data analytic technologies; 
   > Implement the D-SpamPH Mobile Application with Long Short Term Memory Algorithm and evaluate it based on the ISO Standard Quality 9126;
